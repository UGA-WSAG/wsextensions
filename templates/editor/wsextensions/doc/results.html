<p>
The Service Suggestion Engine (SSE) provides tool suggestions to the user as a ranked list, scored in descending order from 1.0 (best) to 0 (worst). 
The implementations of the algorithms used by the SSE expands upon our previous work [1]. 

<h4>Inputs and Scores</h4>

With respect to Galaxy, the SEE considers four things in order to provide suggestions: 
</p>

<ol>

<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>Direction:</strong> Helps the user specify where he or she would like to place the suggested tools in the workflow; 
</li>

<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>Workflow Tool Lists: </strong> Depending on <em>direction</em>, the user adds tools currently on the Workflow Canvas to one or more lists, depending on the relationship each tool should have with tools to be suggested; 
</li>

<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>Candidate Tool List:</strong> The list of tools, added to Galaxy, that are available for use on the Workflow Canvas; and 
</li>

<li>
<strong>Goal / Functionality:</strong> A description of what the suggested operations should help accomplish, provided as either keywords (e.g., "multiple sequence alignment") or as IRI to a term in an ontology. 
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The scores given to each tool in the results (a subset of available tools) is the weighted sum of two subscores:  
</p>

<ul>

<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>Data Mediation (<code>dm</code>):</strong> This sub-score is intended to measure how well the inputs and outputs of a tool can be matched to tools in the various lists chosen by the user, either directly or through some form of data mediation. 
It is based on various structural, semantic and syntactic similarity metrics. 
</li>

<li>
<strong>Functionality (<code>fn</code>):</strong> This sub-score is determined by how well a tool matches the goal specified by the user. 
If no goal is specified, then the overall score for a suggested tool is based only on the <code>dm</code> sub-score. 
</li>

</ul>

<p>
More detailed information about how the exact scores are calculated can be found in [2]. 
For examples, please see the link to more documentation at the bottom of this popup.
