<p>
The Service Suggestion Engine (SSE) provides three types of service suggestion.
</p>
	
<p>
In order to use the SSE, at least one tool needs to be on the current Workflow Canvas. 
Tools in the workflow are added to various lists by the user depending on the type of suggestion chosen and the roles these tools should take. 
The sections below provide information about the three different types of suggestion and their corresponding lists. 
</p>

<h4>
Forward Suggestion

</h4>

<p>
When a "Forward Suggestion" is chosen, the SSE will suggest a list of available tools, ranked according to how well they match some desired functionality and their compatibility with the <em>outputs</em> of tools chosen from the Workflow Canvas. 
The user chooses these <strong>Tools to Feed From</strong> by selecting them from the corresponding drop-down menu that appears in the "Setup & Run Query" panel to the right of the Workflow Canvas. 
In the image to the right, the empty box represents the <em>Tools to feed From</em> and the question mark (?) box represents tools that the user would like suggested. 
</p>

<h4>
Backward Suggestion

</h4>

<p>
When a "Backward Suggestion" is chosen, the SSE will suggest a list of available tools, ranked according to how well they match some desired functionality and their compatibility with the <em>inputs</em> of tools chosen from the Workflow Canvas. 
The user chooses these <strong>Tools to Feed Into</strong> by selecting them from the corresponding drop-down menu that appears in the "Setup & Run Query" panel to the right of the Workflow Canvas. 
In the image to the right, the empty box represents the <em>Tools to feed Into</em> and the question mark (?) box represents tools that the user would like suggested.

</h4>

<p>
When a "Bidirectional Suggestion" is chosen, the SSE will suggest a list of available tools, ranked according to how well they match some desired functionality and their compatibility with the <em>inputs</em> and <em>outputs</em> of certain tools chosen from the Workflow Canvas. 
The user chooses <strong>Tools to Feed From</strong> and <strong>Tools to Feed Into</strong> by selecting them from the corresponding drop-down menus that appears in the "Setup & Run Query" panel to the right of the Workflow Canvas. 
In the image to the right, the left box represents the <em>Tools to feed From</em>, the right box represents the <em>Tools to feed Into</em>, and the question mark (?) box represents tools that the user would like suggested.
